## Questions:
### Should i use cloud?
The script was designed for this purposes, clouds give opportunity to run script 24/7, not like on your pc.
But if you want to, feel free to rewrite script to launch it on your own pc, it requires python module named `vk`.

### Any troubles?
Just ask me any way you want
